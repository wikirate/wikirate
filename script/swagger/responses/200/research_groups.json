      "content": "<p><strong>How the first food corporation, Nestle, impacts our society?</strong></p><p><strong>Good deed</strong></p><p>Nestle is a famous international food manufacturing corporation, founded in 1866 by Henry Nestlé. The brand is now present in over 100 countries all around the world. It is one the world’s largest private nutrition research facility, and has 17 R&amp;D centers worldwide.</p><p>CSR is part of Nestlé’s DNA and is essential in Nestlé’s Management &amp; Leadership Principles, in order to create a long-term value to the society. CSR is a part of its business strategy, and the brand supports the UN Global Compact’s Principles.</p><p>Nestlé tries to ensure the UN Millennium Development Goals through its Shared Value Creation, and tries to reach few goals such as:</p><p>- Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</p><p>- Achieve universal primary education</p><p>- Promote gender equality and empower women</p><p>- Improve maternal health</p><p>- Ensure environmental sustainability</p><p>As an example, since 1960, Nestle Philippines has been helping coffee farmers in different areas of the county through communication of knowledge on how they can improve their crops. Moreover, Nestlé is very dedicating itself for good health and proper nutrition. It conducts feeding programs and medical missions in the areas where it operates. The Group also donate a Classroom Program, a Technical Skills Scholarship Program as well as an Academic Linkage Program.</p><p>Nestlé is also preoccupied by the Environmental Protection and Preservation. The put in place a several programs such as Solid Waste Management Program, The Greening the Supply Chain or Air Emissions Testing, and Water Conservation Program with sensor operated faucets, water gun on all houses at production areas, and water recycling at vacuum pump cooling system.</p><p>To put it in a nutshell, the corporation has been very active in CSR practice and puts premium on programs on agriculture, education, community development and health and nutrition. Their purpose is to enable healthier and happier lives for individuals and families, and helping the development of thriving and resilient communities, and administer the planet’s natural resources for futures generations.</p><p>A part from all that, it is important to know that Nestlé also encountered several sustainable issues, concerning the pollution of water, they want to have a monopoly on water, because they see it as a market value. Furthermore, they had first a big trial in 1970 concerning the importation of powder milk in Africa. And this trouble is still relevant nowadays as there are still laws set-up again all this market.</p><p><strong>Misdeed</strong></p><p>In 1970, Nestlé brought its milk powder as a substitute for breast milk in African countries.This product was safe in Europe, but it was not the case in countries with poor sanitary conditions and where access to drinking water was difficult. Obviously, problems have arisen: the use of slightly contaminated water, and under dosing of the quantities. Nestle, by implementing milk powder, was not sensitive to the idea that the mothers to whom the products were sold were often illiterate and unaware of the risks involved. Sometimes as early as the third month, some mothers are using follow-on milk instead of substitute milk, with the serious risks involved. Because these milks in a row do not have the same nutritional value.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one and a half million newborns die each year because they have not been breastfed properly. They die from the direct or indirect effects of bottle feeding. Since the scandal caused by the English study called \"Baby killers”, a code for the marketing of breast-milk substitutes was adopted in 1981 by the WHO: it prohibits any visible or disguised advertising in favor of milk powder, any distribution of free samples and makes it mandatory to mention the superiority of breast milk over artificial products.</p><p>However, IBFAN, an organization of 150 associations, accuses manufacturers of violating the international code in a study including 31 countries. They established \"the list of 10 violations in 1998\". The network believes that Nestlé, Hipp and Mead Johnson continue to distribute free samples in African countries. IBFAN states that at least 10 international companies, including Nestlé, are aggressively campaigning pregnant women and young mothers to promote their products through TV spots, magazines, and pre-school classes.</p><p>Nestlé refutes these accusations. Nestlé believes that the WHO rules do not cover follow-on milks. \"We scrupulously respect the code of conduct for alternative milks. On the other hand, we believe, unlike the activists, that follow-on milks are not covered. From then on, we feel perfectly free to advertise.\" says Nestlé. UNICEF declared in charge of the case: \"Unfortunately for the health of infants, the conclusions of all these studies are true. Nestlé, like other agribusiness companies, violates the code of conduct, whether through product labeling, marketing and advertising. They claim that the code does not cover follow-on milk. Their interpretation is fallacious \".</p><p>In July 8, 1997, Gabon's Minister of Health accuses Nestlé of \"violating\" national and international legislation and to not take into account \"decisions vital to the survival of the Gabonese child\". Nestle is promoting their products by projecting films in hospital, distribute Cerelac (a dietary supplement who is over dilution can be a cause of malnutrition) and gadgets to mothers and health workers, in flagrant violation of the 1991 Ministerial Decision, the International Code and the UNICEF agreement with the IFM.</p><p><br>For IBFAN and UNICEF, the interests of children's health and the commercial interests of the food industry differ widely. According to UNICEF, a large majority of the 1.5 million infants who are swept away each year by diarrheal dehydration and respiratory diseases, would have seen the severity of their condition alleviated by breastfeeding.</p><p></p><p><strong>Avenel Emilie &amp; Buchalet Marie</strong></p>"
