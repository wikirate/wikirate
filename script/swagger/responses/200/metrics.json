      "methodology": "<p>This metric is asking whether the company has published a statement in relation to the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act or neither. If you can find a relevant statement give the company a \"<strong>Yes - UK Modern Slavery Act</strong>\" and/or \"<strong>Yes - Australian Modern Slavery Act</strong>\" and/or \"<strong>Yes - California Transparency in Supply Chains Act</strong>\" value and add/cite that statement as a source. There are other metrics which ask questions about whether the company's statement complies with the law and whether it contains certain kinds of information. For this metric, any statement that is intended as a \"Modern Slavery Act statement\" counts for a \"<strong>Yes</strong>\" value.</p>\r\n<p>The UK and Australian governments maintain registries of statements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>https://modern-slavery-statement-registry.service.gov.uk/</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://modernslaveryregister.gov.au/\">https://modernslaveryregister.gov.au/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Every quarter, WikiRate retrieves as many statements as it can from these registries using semi-automated techinques so you will find many [[https://wikirate.org/Source?filter%5Breport_type%5D=Modern%20Slavery%20Statement|statements waiting to be assessed on WikiRate]].</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore the [[https://business-humanrights.org|Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre]] maintains an [[https://www.modernslaveryregistry.org|archive of Modern Slavery Act statements]].</p>\r\n<p>If the company you are researching does not appear on the registries, try searching the web for terms like \"[Company name] modern slavery statement\". These statements should be linked to from a company's homepage but this is not always the case.</p>\r\n<p>These statements can be called things like:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Modern Slavery Act statement</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Slavery and Trafficking statement</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you cannot find a relevant statement by the company, and you believe they are required to produce one, add a new \"report\" source that explains how you searched, and give the company a value of \"<strong>No - neither</strong>\".</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>* Note on choosing the Year of your answer</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Read the MSA Statement carefully to find out what year it covers.</p>\r\n<p>When a statement is referring to a Financial Year (FY) ending in Q1 or early Q2, it should be labeled with the previous year. Example:</p>\r\n<p><br>Statement for FY2018/19 ending in <strong>April </strong>2019 = 2018<br>Statement for FY2018/19 ending in <strong>May</strong> 2019 (or later) = 2019</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><br><br></p>",
