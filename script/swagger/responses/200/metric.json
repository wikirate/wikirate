    "content": "<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">This metric is based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standard Guidelines. </p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">In 2018, the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines were superseded by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI standards).</span><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\"> For this metric, the code </span><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">G4-EN15-a is used in company reporting prior to 2018</span>, and the new </span><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">GRI 305-1</span> <span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">code used in reporting from 2018 onwards</span>. The </span><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">methodology for the former G4 standard for this metric can be found <a href=\"/Direct_greenhouse_gas_GHG_emissions_Scope_1_G4_EN15_a_Methodology\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">In the context of the GRI Standards, the environmental dimension of sustainability concerns an organization’s impacts on living and non-living natural systems, including land, air, water and ecosystems.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\"><a href=\"/Source_000089851\" target=\"_blank\">GRI 305</a> addresses emissions into air, which are the discharge of substances from a source into the atmosphere. Types of emissions include: greenhouse gas (GHG), ozone-depleting substances (ODS), and nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulfur oxides (SOX), among other significant air emissions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">GHG emissions are a major contributor to climate change and are governed by the United Nations (UN) ‘Framework Convention on Climate Change’ and the subsequent UN ‘Kyoto Protocol’. This Standard covers the following GHGs:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">\r\n<li>Carbon dioxide (CO2)</li>\r\n<li>Methane (CH4)</li>\r\n<li>Nitrous oxide (N2O)</li>\r\n<li>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</li>\r\n<li>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)</li>\r\n<li>Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)</li>\r\n<li>Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">Some GHGs, including methane, are also air pollutants that have significant adverse impacts on ecosystems, air quality, agriculture, and human and animal health.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">As a result, different national and international regulations and incentive systems, such as emissions trading, aim to control the volume and reward the reduction of GHG emissions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">The GHG Protocol has established a classification of GHG emissions called ‘Scope’: Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3. The GHG emissions standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ‘ISO 14064’, represents these classifications of Scope with the following terms:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">\r\n<li>Direct GHG emissions (<span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Scope 1</span>): GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by an organization</li>\r\n<li>Energy indirect GHG emissions (<span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Scope 2</span>): GHG emissions that result from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by an organization</li>\r\n<li>Other indirect GHG emissions (<span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Scope 3</span>): Indirect GHG emissions not included in energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions that occur outside of the organization, including both upstream and downstream emissions</li>\r\n</ul>"
