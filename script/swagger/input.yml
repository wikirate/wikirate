  title: 'WikiRate API'
  description: >-
    API to access WikiRate's data. To get the JSON responses as described below, you can (1) set the http access header to `application/json` in your request, (2) append `.json` to the request urls, or (3) add `format=json` to the query params.

      WikiRate is built with Decko, and is thus constructed from _cards_. Everything in Decko is a card, including images, accounts, searches, fields, etc. So every request for a webpage on WikiRate.org or via its REST API is for a _card_.

      The documentation below is divided into generic Decko card documentation (under `Decko`) and more WikiRate-specific cardtypes (under `WikiRate`).
tags:
- name: Decko
  description: |-
    "Cards" are the building blocks of Decko (and thus WikiRate). All requests
    are CRUD operations on cards.
- name: WikiRate
  description: |-
    RESTful Decko api calls can be made with any card on WikiRate. The
    following examples feature some customized JSON views.

        The card parameter contains card field data, subcard field data.
        It follows RubyOnRails hash parameter pattern; for example,
        the company's name is represented as `card[name]=MyCompanyName`.

        `card[name]` and `card[type]=Company` are required to create a company

        You can also include subcards such as the wikipedia or opencorporates mapping. For example:

        - `card[subcards][+wikipedia]=MyCompanyWikipediaName`
        - `card[subcards][+open_corporates]=MyCompanyOpenCorporatesEntityID`

        Same filter options as GUI in RubyOnRails hash parameter style,
        eg `filter[status]=known`.

        - **status:** all, exists (researched), known, unknown, or none (not researched)
        - **year:** answer year
        - **value:** answer value to match, OR a hash with `to` and/or `from` keys to
          represent a range (eg `filter[value][from]=5`
        - **updated:** today, week, or month (returns answers updated in that time range)
        - **source:** source card name(s). restrict to answers citing source
        - **project:** project card name(s). restrict to answers connected to project
        - **check:** Completed, Requested, or Neither

        {company}+Answer only:
        - **metric_name:** string to match (or exact name in quotes)
        - **metric_id:** numerical_id
        - **metric_type:** name of "metric type" card (Researched, Relationship, Formula,
          WikiRating, Score, or Descendant)
        - **topic:** topic card name(s). restrict to metrics with topic
        - **research policy:** name of research policy card

        {metric}+Answer only:
        - **company_name:** string to match (or exact name in quotes)
        - **company_id:** numerical id
        - **outliers:** only, exclude

        Note: arrays can be represented in RubyOnRails array parameter style, eg:
        `filter[topic][]=human+rights&filter[topic][]=climate+change`

      schema:
        type: array

      description:
        The name of an answer follows the pattern Metric+Company+Year.  (Note,
        the name of a company follows the pattern Designer+Title).

        Any piece of the name (or the entire name ) can be substituted with its numerical
        id in the form of `~INTEGER`.  Eg, if your metric's id is 867 and your company's
        id is 5309, then you can address the answer as ~867+~5309+1981

        An answer can have several subcards, including:

        - **+:value**: the answer value
        - **+:source**: (required) list of source card names separated by line breaks.  All answers
          must have valid sources.
        - **+:checked_by**: value can be a list of names separated by line breaks or
          `[[request]]` to indicate that a check is requested.
        - **+:discussion**: initial comment for discussion
      schema:
        type: object
        example: card[subcards][+:checked_by]=[[request]]
    source_subcards:
      name: card[subcards]
      in: query
      description: |-
        An source can have several subcards.

        First, the source must refer to an actual document. The most standard way to
        do that is with a url.

        - **+link**: url string

        It is also possible to upload a file source. (Documentation coming soon).


        In general the following subcards are also required:

        - **+title**: a short readable title for the source
        - **+company**: a newline-separated list of companies to which the source applies
        - **+year**: a newline-separated list of years to which the the source applies
        - **+report type**: a newline-separate list of report types to which the source
          applies.  (See http://wikirate.org/Report_Type

        The above requirements are extremely helpful in making the sources usable via
        WikiRate's research pages.  However, if you plan to use the sources immediately
        in a citation (eg via uploads or API calls), you may avoid the requirements using
        `card[skip]=requirements`.

        Another optional subcard field:

        - **+description**: a paragraph or two about the contents of the source

        example: card[subcards][+link]=http://mysource.com/mysourcepage.html
