    <p>
      WikiRate is an open data platform powered by a diverse community that collects,
      analyzes and shares data on company commitments, actions and impacts on people and
      the planet.
    </p>

    <p>
      As company stakeholders we all have avenues to influence corporate behavior. It
      might be taking more informed consumption, investment, employment, or governance
      decisions. It might be writing a compelling academic paper, running an advocacy
      campaign, or submitting a proposal for legislative reform. No matter what our road
      to impact is, the data is our shared beginning.
    </p>
