    <p>
      WikiRate is an open data platform powered by a diverse community that
      collects, analyzes and shares data on company commitments, actions and impacts on
      people and the planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As company stakeholders we all have avenues to influence corporate behavior. It 
      might be taking more informed consumption, investment, employment, or governance 
      decisions. It might be writing a compelling academic paper,
      running an advocacy campaign, or submitting a proposal for legislative reform. No
      matter what our road to impact is, the data is our shared beginning.
