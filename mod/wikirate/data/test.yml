      <p>Fashion Checker is a data tool that connects the dots between brand commitments on living wages and the reality for workers on the ground.</p>
      <p>The project is coordinated by <a href="https://cleanclothes.org/">Clean Clothes Campaign</a> in partnership with <a href="https://semcon.com/">Semcon</a>, <a href="https://wageindicator.org/">WageIndicator</a> and <a href="/">WikiRate</a>. The campaign seeks to make brands accountable for their promises on living wages and invites the public in to explore the data.</p>
      <p>Through the tool you can explore how companies score on currently paying their workers a living wage, the transparency of their supply chain and their commitments to paying workers a living wage in the future.</p>
      <p>The tool also pulls in data on the companyâ€™s supply chain including gender breakdowns of workers, the actual to minimum wage pay gap and collective bargaining agreements.</p>
