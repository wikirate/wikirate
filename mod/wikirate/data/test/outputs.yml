      of a benchmarking study of implementation of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance
      for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk
      Areas (“Minerals Guidance”) by a global sample of companies producing, trading and
      sourcing minerals or metals based on their public disclosures. The study provides
      evidence of the Minerals Guidance’s role as the keystone in an emerging global
      architecture for responsible business conduct in mineral supply chains, with
      a significant expansion in its uptake between 2014 and 2018.</p>\r\n<p>The study
      also reveals major shortcomings in disclosure related to implementation, especially
      on how companies use due diligence practically to identify and mitigate risks.
      In part, this suggests growing pains as companies move beyond compliance-based
      approaches typically focussed on risks to the company, to a due diligence framework
      that emphasizes progressive improvement to address adversempacts external to
      the company, including through responsible engagement in complex operating environments.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>This

      as drawing attention to both promising, and less promising, business practice.
      In doing so, we can both unlock the content of these statements and provide

    :description: "<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>\r\n<p>Since
      the end of the 20th century, the role of private multinational enterprises (MNEs)
      has been recognized as critical in implementing increased sustainable production
      and consumption patterns. Particularly after the creation of the Sustainable
      Development Goals (SDGs) and the Agenda 2030, this role has increased. In this
      sense, this paper aims to analyze the measures and actions taken by companies
      in their contribution to the achievement of the SDG 12. Through the identification
      of more than 52 metrics in sustainability reports of 854 firms, findings suggest
      that direct greenhouse gas emissions and indirect greenhouse gas emissions are
      the most often reported corporate metrics to measure their impact on specific
      SDGs. This reveals the importance of sustainability actions in emerging market
      firms as a mechanism to gain legitimacy when operating in foreign markets and
      as an opportunity to create more sustainable production models.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Authors</strong>:

    :description: "<p><strong>About</strong></p>\r\n<p>This paper considers an alternative
      way of gathering and evaluating information on corporate social responsibility
      (CSR) and the actions taken towards sustainable development. Social accounting
      theory is currently limited in conceptualising external accounts that sit outside
      the description of silent or shadow accounts. With the emergence of technological
      platforms that enable CSR information to be collectively located, new models
      of stakeholder engagement are growing using the wisdom of the crowd for information
      collation and analyses. This paper outlines a crowdsourced platform, Wikirate,
      which aims to both empower corporate transparency surrounding the Sustainable
      Development Goals and assist in multidimensional stakeholder participation and
      decision making. Existing theoretical characterisations of external accounts
      are used as a way of understanding the Wikirate engagement model and more broadly
      its relationship with social accounting. Through analysis and theoretical development,
      this research has implications for imagining and exploring new social accountings
      and social accountants that can lead to emancipatory change. ‘Spotlight accounting’
      is introduced as a process that illuminates global organisational transparency
      and sustainability through crowdsourcing by independent stakeholders.</p>"

      continues to see uninterrupted growth, with more people than ever before travelling
      for work or leisure to a broader range of destinations. Yet this growth brings
      with it a greater risk of modern slavery.</p>\r\n<p>There is a high-risk of
      exploitation within the hotel sector due to its vulnerable workforce, complex
      supply chains with little transparency, and limited oversight from brands and
      multinational hotel companies as a result of extensive franchising. In the franchising
      model, hotel brands lend their name and customer care standards to third parties,
      but usually stipulate far less about the standards they expect for the employment
      of workers, even in countries where abuse is endemic.</p>\r\n<p>To assess how
      the hotel sector is responding to these risks, this report reviews the statements
      produced by 71 hotel companies under the UK Modern Slavery Act, which requires
      companies with a turnover of £36 million to release annual statements on their
      anti-slavery efforts. We looked at whether the statements meet the Act’s minimum
      requirements, but also if they go “beyond compliance” with effective responses

      Wikirate Project e.V. (Wikirate), the UN Global Compact, and the Bertelsmann
      Stiftung. The aims of the pilot stage of the project were to:</p>\r\n<p>1. 
      Embed the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development
      Goals (SDGs) in the minds of the next generation of business leaders through
      active research and analysis, promoting engagement and familiarity with companies’
      reporting outputs<br>2. Seek structured ways of tracking company performance
      towards the SDGs and the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles, testing a broad
      selection of metrics of performance from standards like the Global Reporting
      Initiative and UN Global Compact’s Poverty Footprint.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:
      justify;\">The pilot included 9 higher education institutions, with 13 professors
      in 7 countries across 5 continents, engaging 950 students and generating over
      20,000 data points on corporate sustainability performance. Student participants
      with different levels of education, from first year undergraduates through master’s
      students, generated data through researching corporate sustainability and annual
      reports of Global Compact participants submitted as Communication on Progress
      reports (COPs), and added it to the Wikirate platform.</p>\r\n</div>"

    :description: "<p>Thirteen million workers who toil on tea plantations have suffered
      from endemic human rights abuses while the tea companies they pick for - some
      of the world’s largest and most profitable companies - have evaded responsibility
      for their supply chain workers and kept their supply chains hidden. Without
      supply chain transparency, workers don’t know where the tea they pick goes and
      remediation for abuses from forced labour to gender-based violence stop at the
      estate instead of going up the chain to where most of the value lies.</p>\r\n<p>The
      Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre addressed this gap by approaching
      65 companies with a request for them to disclose the estates and bought-leaf
      factories that they source their tea from, to be held centrally in the first
      Tea Transparency Tracker. There are over 3100 estates and factories linked to
      20 companies within the Tracker, and all disclosed supplier data is also available
      under a Creative Commons licence via Wikirate. <span>As
      part of this project, Wikirate produced an interactive map showing tea supply
      chain locations per country. </span></p>"
