    and be wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially
    when debating the merits of options. </p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </p>\r\n<h4

    Attacks</h4>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Conflicts will inevitably arise,
    but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult,
    demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs, and
    ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and

    includes questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re
    unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle
    and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.</p>\r\n<p

    welcome you (“you” or the “user”) as a reader, editor, author, or contributor
    of the Wikirate website (\"Wikirate\" or \"Project\"), and we encourage you to

    style=\"font-size: 14px;\">These Terms of Use tell you about our public services
    at Wikirate e.V., our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities
    that guide us both. Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content
    (with the rare exception of policies like these Terms of Use or legal compliance
    for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act|DMCA]] notices).
    This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users
    who create and manage the content. We merely host this content.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:

    Wikirate - are the principal means through which the goals of the mission are
    achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our sites. The community
    undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies.</p>\r\n<p
    style=\"font-size: 14px;\">You are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or
    author, but you should follow the policies. Because we are dedicated to making
    content freely accessible to the public, we generally require that all content
    you contribute is available under a free license or in the public domain.</p>\r\n<p
    style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Please be aware that you are legally responsible for
    all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of Wikirate content under the laws
    of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include the
    laws where you live or where you view or edit content). This means it is important
    that you use caution when posting content. In light of this responsibility, we
    have some rules about what you cannot post, most of which is either for your own
    protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in
    mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if
    you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial
    issues), you should seek the help of a licensed or qualified professional. We

    e.V. is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free
    content, and to hosting the full content of this wiki-based Project for the public
    free of charge. However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure
    and organizational framework that allows our users to build Wikirate by contributing
    and editing content themselves. Because of our unique role, there are a couple
    of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the
    Projects, and the other users:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\r\n<li><span
    style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">We do not take an editorial role:</span> Because
    Wikirate is collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided
    by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role. This means that
    we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project, and we do not
    take any responsibility for this content. Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions
    expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness,
    accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content. Instead, we simply
    provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.</li>\r\n<li><span
    style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">You are responsible for your own actions:</span> You

    see our licensing policy here: [[Licensing]]. Please see general additional points
    below which we will update in due course.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To
    grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to
    Wikirate are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute
    and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed
    and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative
    works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible
    audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so
    that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:
    14px;\">You agree to the following licensing requirements:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"font-size:
    14px;\">\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Text to which you hold the
    copyright: </span>When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree
    to license it under: [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/|Creative Commons
    - Attribution 4.0 International License]] (“CC BY\"). Please note that these licenses
    do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant
    with the terms.</li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Attribution: </span>Attribution
    is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit
    is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed
    in any of the following fashions:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Through hyperlink (where possible)
    or URL to the overview to which you contributed (since each overview has a history
    page that lists all authors and editors);</li>\r\n<li>Through hyperlink (where
    possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible,
    which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a
    manner equivalent to the credit given on Wikirate ; or</li>\r\n<li>Through a list
    of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude
    very small or irrelevant contributions).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:
    bolder;\">Importing text: </span>You may import text that you have found elsewhere
    or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the
    text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY 4.0 license (\"CC
    BY\").<br>\r\n<p>You agree that, if you import text under a CC BY license that
    requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where
    such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikirate-internal
    copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is answered
    in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are
    sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license),
    and there may be instances where the Wikirate community decides that imported
    text cannot be used for that reason.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
    bolder;\">Non-text media:</span> Non-text media on Wikirate are available under
    a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted
    re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply
    with the requirements for such licenses as described in our [[Licensing]] Policy.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span
    style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">No revocation of license:</span> Except as consistent
    with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation
    of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content
    or non-text media contributed to Wikirate, even if you terminate use of our services.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span
    style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Public domain content:</span> Content that is in
    the public domain is welcome! It is important however that you confirm the public
    domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as
    well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition.
    When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the
    material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span
    style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Re-use: </span>Re-use of content that we host is
    welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under \"fair use\" or
    similar exemptions under copyright law. Any re-use must comply with the underlying
    license(s).</p>\r\n<p>When you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by
    the Wikirate community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following
    fashions:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the
    page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists
    all authors and editors);</li>\r\n<li>Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL
    to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms
    with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent
    to the credit given on the Project website; or</li>\r\n<li>Through a list of all
    authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very
    small or irrelevant contributions).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In addition, please be
    aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into Wikirate
    may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users
    agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Such requirements
    may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or
    all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible
    notations, re-users should preserve them.</p>\r\n<p>For any non-text media, you
    agree to comply with whatever license under which the work has been made available
    (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing
    section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that
    work). When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant
    attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><span
    style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Modifications or additions to material that you
    re-use:  </span>When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained
    from Wikirate, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY
    4.0 or later.\r\n<p>When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that
    you have obtained from Wikirate, you agree to license the modified or added content
    in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.</p>\r\n<p>With
    both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original
    work has been modified. If you are re-using text content in a wiki, it is sufficient
    to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For
    each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing
    notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink
    or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h1

    style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Please see our [[Notice_and_take_down_procedure |Notice
    and Take Down]] policy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Wikirate e.V. wants
    to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users without
    fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others.
    In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders,
    our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the
    formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant to the DMCA,
    we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of
    our system and network who are repeat infringers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:
    14px;\">However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or
    in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications
    when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper.</p>\r\n<p
    style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If you are the owner of content that is being improperly
    used on Wikirate without your permission, you may request that the content be
    removed under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at legal@wikirate.org.</p>\r\n<p
    style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Alternatively, you may make a request to our community,
    which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than prescribed
    under the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright
    concerns. Before filing a DMCA note, you also have the option of sending us an
    email at info@wikirate.org.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"font-size: calc(1.375rem + 1.5vw);

    community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies. At Wikirate
    e.V., we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement.
    In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address
    an especially problematic user because of significant disturbance or dangerous
    behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation
    to:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\r\n<li>Investigate your use of the
    service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition
    policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with
    any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;</li>\r\n<li>Detect,
    prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond
    to user support requests;</li>\r\n<li>Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the
    contribution of any user who violates these Terms of Use;</li>\r\n<li>Ban a user
    from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating
    these Terms of Use, including repeat copyright infringement;</li>\r\n<li>Take
    legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to
    law enforcement authorities); and</li>\r\n<li>Manage otherwise the Wikirate website
    in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights,
    property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the
    public.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In the interests of our
    users and the Project, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had
    his or her account or access blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited
    from creating or using another account, unless we provide explicit permission.
    Without limiting the authority of the community, The Wikirate Project itself will
    not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access
    solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise
    violating these Terms of Use or community policies.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:
    14px;\">The Wikirate community and its members may also take action when so allowed
    by the community or applicable policies, including but not limited to warning,
    investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree
    to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established
    by the community (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include
    sanctions as set out by the policy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The blocking
    of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be

    to Wikirate, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely)
    circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikirate community
    or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services,
    terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user.
    If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your
    public contributions will remain publicly available (subject to applicable policies),
    and, unless we notify you otherwise, you may still access our public pages for
    the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on Wikirate. In such circumstances,
    however, you may not be able to access your account or settings. We reserve the
    right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with
    or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or
    otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to
    relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.</p>\r\n<div

    Disputes and Jurisdiction</h1>\r\n<p>We hope that no serious disagreements arise
    involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek
    resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by
    Wikirate e.V. If you seek to file a legal note against us, you agree to file and
    resolve it exclusively in a court located in Berlin, Germany. You also agree that
    German law will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal note that might
    arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You
    agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper
    in, the courts located in Berlin, Germany, in any legal action or proceeding relating
    to us or these Terms of Use.</p>\r\n<p>To ensure that disputes are dealt with
    soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
    contrary, any note or cause of action you might have arising out of or related
    to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable
    statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts
    underlying such note or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable

    for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors,
    officers, employees, and agents from any notes and damages, known and unknown,
    arising out of or in any way connected with any note you have against any such
    third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by
    you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly
    stated in these Terms of Use.</p>\r\n<p>Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained
    through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and
    you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss
    of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we

    but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other
    intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of
    such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars
    (USD 1000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the
    limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the
    above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will

    is essential for the growth and maintenance of Wikirate, we believe that community
    input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also
    essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use,
    as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community
    for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If
    a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days

    statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least
    three (3) days' notice.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Because it may be
    necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice
    of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via a notification on [[Wikirate
    Legal Announcements]]. However, we ask that you please periodically review the
    most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services
    after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period
    constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection
    of Wikirate e.V. and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms
    of Use, you cannot use our services.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"font-size: calc(1.375rem

      of Use</h1>\r\n<p>Welcome to Wikirate! The Wikirate Project e.V. (“we” or “us”),
      is a nonprofit charitable organization whose mission to empower better decision
      making and help tackle the world’s challenges with open and actionable data.</p>\r\n<p>To
      support our community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational
      framework for the development of Wikirate. We strive to make and keep educational
      and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of
      charge, in perpetuity.</p>\r\n<p>We welcome you (“you” or the “user”) as a reader,
      editor, author, or contributor of the Wikirate website (\"Wikirate\" or \"Project\"),
      and we encourage you to join the Wikirate community. Before you participate,
      however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use
      (“Terms of Use”).</p>\r\n<h1>Overview</h1>\r\n<p>These Terms of Use tell you
      about our public services at Wikirate e.V., our relationship to you as a user,
      and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. Generally we do not
      contribute, monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies
      like these Terms of Use or legal compliance for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act|DMCA]]
      notices). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your
      fellow users who create and manage the content. We merely host this content.</p>\r\n<p>The
      community - the network of users who are constantly building and using Wikirate
      - are the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved.
      The community contributes to and helps govern our sites. The community undertakes
      the critical function of creating and enforcing policies.</p>\r\n<p>You are
      welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the
      policies. Because we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the
      public, we generally require that all content you contribute is available under
      a free license or in the public domain.</p>\r\n<p>Please be aware that you are
      legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of Wikirate
      content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable
      laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content).
      This means it is important that you use caution when posting content. In light
      of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot post, most
      of which is either for your own protection or for the protection of other users
      like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational
      purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such
      as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of a licensed
      or qualified professional. We also include other important notices and disnoteers,
      so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.</p>\r\n<h1>1. Our Services</h1>\r\n<p>Wikirate
      e.V. is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of
      free content, and to hosting the full content of this wiki-based Project for
      the public free of charge. However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining
      the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our users to build
      Wikirate by contributing and editing content themselves. Because of our unique
      role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our
      relationship to you, the Projects, and the other users:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>We
      do not take an editorial role: </strong>Because Wikirate is collaboratively
      edited, all of the content that we host is provided by users like yourself,
      and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor
      or edit the content of the Project, and we do not take any responsibility for
      this content. Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services,
      and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability
      of any submitted community content. Instead, we simply provide access to the
      content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.</li>\r\n<li><strong>You
      are responsible for your own actions:</strong> You are legally responsible for
      your edits and contributions on Wikirate, so for your own protection you should
      exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal
      or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes
      at least the laws of the United States of America. Although we may not agree
      with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek
      to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where
      you view or edit content. The Wikirate Project generally cannot offer any protection,
      guarantee, immunity or indemnification.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h1>2. Privacy Policy</h1>\r\n<p>We
      ask that you review the terms of our [[Privacy Policy]], so that you are aware
      of how we collect and use your information. Because our services are used by
      people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored
      and processed in the United States of America or any other country in which
      we or our agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to
      any such transfer of information outside your country.</p>\r\n<h1>3. Content
      We Host</h1>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>You may find some material objectionable
      or erroneous:</strong> Because we provide a wide array of content that is produced
      or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive,
      erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore
      ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Our
      content is for general informational purposes only: </strong>Although we host
      a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including
      medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational
      purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent
      professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable
      area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in the
      Project.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h1>4. Refraining from Certain Activities</h1>\r\n<p>The
      Project hosted by Wikirate e.V. only exists because of the vibrant community
      of users like you who collaborate together to write, edit, and curate the content.
      We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to
      be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act
      in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission
      of the shared Project.</p>\r\n<p>Certain activities, whether legal or illegal,
      may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may
      also subject you to liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that
      of other users, you may not engage in such activities on our sites. These activities
      include:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Harassing and Abusing Others</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Engaging
      in harassment, threats, stalking, spamming, or vandalism; and</li>\r\n<li>Transmitting
      chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Violating
      the Privacy of Others</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Infringing the privacy rights
      of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable
      laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content);</li>\r\n<li>Soliciting
      personally identifiable information for purposes of harassment, exploitation,
      violation of privacy, or any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly
      approved by Wikirate e.V.; and</li>\r\n<li>Soliciting personally identifiable
      information from anyone under the age of 18 for an illegal purpose or violating
      any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Engaging
      in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Intentionally
      or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation;</li>\r\n<li>With
      the intent to deceive, posting content that is false or inaccurate;</li>\r\n<li>Attempting
      to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation
      with any individual or entity, or using the username of another user with the
      intent to deceive; and</li>\r\n<li>Engaging in fraud.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Committing
      Infringement</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Infringing copyrights, trademarks,
      patents, or other proprietary rights under applicable law.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Misusing
      Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Posting
      child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning
      child pornography;</li>\r\n<li>Posting or trafficking in obscene material that
      is unlawful under applicable law; and</li>\r\n<li>Using the services in a manner
      that is inconsistent with applicable law.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Engaging
      in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Posting
      or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses,
      malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure
      or system or that of our users;</li>\r\n<li>Engaging in automated uses of the
      site that are abusive or disruptive of the services and have not been approved
      by  Wikirate;</li>\r\n<li>Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden
      on Wikirate or the networks or servers connected with Wikirate;</li>\r\n<li>Disrupting
      the services by inundating Wikirate with communications or other traffic that
      suggests no serious intent to use Wikirate for its stated purpose;</li>\r\n<li>Knowingly
      accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer
      systems without authorization; and</li>\r\n<li>Probing, scanning, or testing
      the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the
      following conditions are met:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>such actions do not
      unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;</li>\r\n<li>such
      actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);</li>\r\n<li>you
      report any vulnerabilities to Wagn developers (or fix it yourself); and</li>\r\n<li>you
      do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We
      reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the
      above terms.</p>\r\n<h1>5. Password Security</h1>\r\n<p>You are responsible
      for safeguarding your own password and should never disclose it to any third
      party.</p>\r\n<h1>6. Trademarks</h1>\r\n<p>Wikirate is a registered trademark.
      We ask that you please treat any of our names, service marks, logos, or domain
      names accordingly.</p>\r\n<h1>7. Licensing of Content</h1>\r\n<p>Please see
      our licensing policy here: [[Licensing]]. Please see general additional points
      below which we will update in due course.</p>\r\n<p>To grow the commons of free
      knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to Wikirate are required
      to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use
      their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the
      same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works.
      In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible
      audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so
      that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.</p>\r\n<p>You agree
      to the following licensing requirements:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Text to
      which you hold the copyright:</strong> When you submit text to which you hold
      the copyright, you agree to license it under: [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/|Creative
      Commons - Attribution 4.0 International License]] (“CC BY\"). Please note that
      these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such
      uses are compliant with the terms.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Attribution: </strong>Attribution
      is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit
      is due – to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be
      attributed in any of the following fashions:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Through hyperlink
      (where possible) or URL to the overview to which you contributed (since each
      overview has a history page that lists all authors and editors);</li>\r\n<li>Through
      hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that
      is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit
      to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on Wikirate ; or</li>\r\n<li>Through
      a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered
      to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Importing
      text:</strong> You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you
      have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the text is
      available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY 4.0 license (\"CC BY\").<br>\r\n<p>You
      agree that, if you import text under a CC BY license that requires attribution,
      you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is
      commonly given through page histories (such as Wikirate-internal copying), it
      is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is answered in
      the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are
      sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license),
      and there may be instances where the Wikirate community decides that imported
      text cannot be used for that reason.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Non-text
      media:</strong> Non-text media on Wikirate are available under a variety of
      different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use
      and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply
      with the requirements for such licenses as described in our [[Licensing]] Policy.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>No
      revocation of license:</strong> Except as consistent with your license, you
      agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license
      that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text
      media contributed to Wikirate, even if you terminate use of our services.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Public
      domain content: </strong>Content that is in the public domain is welcome! It
      is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content
      under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other
      countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content
      that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the
      public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Re-use:</strong> Re-use
      of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed
      under \"fair use\" or similar exemptions under copyright law. Any re-use must
      comply with the underlying license(s).</p>\r\n<p>When you re-use or re-distribute
      a text page developed by the Wikirate community, you agree to attribute the
      authors in any of the following fashions:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Through hyperlink
      (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each
      page has a history page that lists all authors and editors);</li>\r\n<li>Through
      hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that
      is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit
      to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website;
      or</li>\r\n<li>Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list
      of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In
      addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and
      was imported into Wikirate may be under a license that attaches additional attribution
      requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements
      clearly. Such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other notations
      pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere.
      Where there are such visible notations, re-users should preserve them.</p>\r\n<p>For
      any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which the
      work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work
      and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an
      applicable source page for that work). When re-using any content that we host,
      you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain
      to the underlying license or licenses.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Modifications
      or additions to material that you re-use:</strong>  When modifying or making
      additions to text that you have obtained from Wikirate, you agree to license
      the modified or added content under CC BY 4.0 or later.\r\n<p>When modifying
      or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from Wikirate,
      you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever
      license under which the work has been made available.</p>\r\n<p>With both text
      content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original
      work has been modified. If you are re-using text content in a wiki, it is sufficient
      to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text.
      For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include
      a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with
      either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license
      itself.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h1>8. DMCA Compliance</h1>\r\n<p>Please see
      our [[Notice_and_take_down_procedure |Notice and Take Down]] policy.</p>\r\n<p>Wikirate
      e.V. wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users
      without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights
      of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright
      holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply
      with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant
      to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account
      holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers.</p>\r\n<p>However,
      we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith.
      In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when
      they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper.</p>\r\n<p>If
      you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on Wikirate without
      your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA.
      To make such a request, please email us at legal@wikirate.org.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively,
      you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues
      faster and more effectively than prescribed under the DMCA. In that case, you
      can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. Before filing a DMCA note,
      you also have the option of sending us an email at info@wikirate.org.</p>\r\n<h1>9.
      Third-party Websites and Resources</h1>\r\n<p>You are solely responsible for
      your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although WikiRate contains
      links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible
      or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products,
      or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features),
      nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.</p>\r\n<h1>10.
      Management of Websites</h1>\r\n<p>The community has the primary role in creating
      and enforcing policies. At WikiRate e.V., we rarely intervene in community decisions
      about policy and its enforcement. In an unusual case, the need may arise, or
      the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user because
      of significant disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve
      the right, but do not have the obligation to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Investigate
      your use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms
      of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred,
      or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental
      request;</li>\r\n<li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security,
      or technical issues or respond to user support requests;</li>\r\n<li>Refuse,
      disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user who violates these
      Terms of Use;</li>\r\n<li>Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a
      user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including
      repeat copyright infringement;</li>\r\n<li>Take legal action against users who
      violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities);
      and</li>\r\n<li>Manage otherwise the WikiRate website in a manner designed to
      facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety
      of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In
      the interests of our users and the Project, in the extreme circumstance that
      any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this provision,
      he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account, unless we provide
      explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community, The Wikirate
      Project itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's
      account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result
      in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.</p>\r\n<p>The
      WikiRate community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the
      community or applicable policies, including but not limited to warning, investigating,
      blocking, or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with
      the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the

      as set out by the policy.</p>\r\n<p>The blocking of an account or access or
      the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section
      12 of these Terms of Use.</p>\r\n<h1>11. Resolutions and Project Policies</h1>\r\n<p>WikiRate
      e.V.'s Board of Trustees releases [[https://wikirate.org/Wikirate_Policiesl
      | official policies]] from time to time. You agree to abide by them as applicable.</p>\r\n<h1>12.
      Termination</h1>\r\n<p>Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute
      to WikiRate, you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully
      unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikirate
      community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all
      of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access,
      or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated
      for any reason, your public contributions will remain publicly available (subject
      to applicable policies), and, unless we notify you otherwise, you may still
      access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content
      on WikiRate. In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your
      account or settings. We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at
      any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your
      use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms
      of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including
      Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>13. Disputes and Jurisdiction</h1>\r\n<p>We
      hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there
      is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution
      procedures or mechanisms provided by WikiRate e.V. If you seek to file a legal
      note against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a court located
      in Berlin, Germany. You also agree that German law will govern these Terms of
      Use, as well as any legal note that might arise between you and us (without
      reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in Berlin,
      Germany, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of
      Use.</p>\r\n<p>To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise,
      you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any note or
      cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services
      or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations
      or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such note
      or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or
      be forever barred).</p>\r\n<h1>14. Disclaimers</h1>\r\n<p>At WikiRate e.V.,
      we do our best to provide informational content to a very wide audience, but
      your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on
      an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis, and we expressly disnote all express
      or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied
      warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
      We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe,
      secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information
      will be secure.</p>\r\n<p>We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions
      of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and
      agents from any notes and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any
      way connected with any note you have against any such third parties. No advice
      or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through
      or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms
      of Use.</p>\r\n<p>Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your
      use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be
      solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that
      results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility
      or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any
      content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create
      limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without
      notice.</p>\r\n<p>Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disnoteers
      in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending
      on the law.</p>\r\n<h1>15. Limitation on Liability</h1>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>WikiRate
      e.V. will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect,
      incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited
      to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses,
      regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In
      no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00)
      in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or
      exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation
      or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to
      the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</div>\r\n<h1>16. Modifications
      to these Terms of Use</h1>\r\n<p>Just as the WikiRate community's input is essential
      for the growth and maintenance of WikiRate, we believe that community input
      is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also
      essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use,
      as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community
      for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period.
      If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional
      30 days for comments. For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct
      an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will
      provide at least three (3) days' notice.</p>\r\n<p>Because it may be necessary
      to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such
      modifications and the opportunity to comment via a notification on [[WikiRate
      Legal Announcements]]. However, we ask that you please periodically review the
      most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of our services
      after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period
      constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part. For the protection
      of WikiRate e.V. and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our
      Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.</p>\r\n<h1>17. Other Terms</h1>\r\n<p>These
      Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture
      relationship between you and us, WikiRate e.V. If you have not signed a separate
      agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and
      us. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written
      agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.</p>\r\n<p>You
      agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes
      to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on WikiRate.</p>\r\n<p>If
      in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms
      of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.</p>\r\n<p>You understand that,
      unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation
      for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community,
      The WikiRate Project e.V., The WikiRate Project (US entity) and the WikiRate
      Project UK.</p>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these
      Terms of Use, we (The WikiRate Project e.V.) and you agree not to modify the
      applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the
      Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms
      of Use.</p>\r\n<p>If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of
      Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
      provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to
      the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use
      will remain in full force and effect.</p>\r\n<h1>Thank You!</h1>\r\n<p>We appreciate
      your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have
