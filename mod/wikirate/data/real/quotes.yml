      WikiRate provides an essential open data infrastructure for supply chain 
      transparency. Their system made it possible to connect data reported by brands and 
      workers in one dynamic tool: Fashion Checker. Through this flexible and engaging 
      structure, we were able to make a complex dataset on supply chain wages accessible 
      and useful to a broad audience of consumers, journalists, advocacy organizations, 
      and workers themselves.

      Our collaborative project was a great opportunity to further develop our research 
      skills which in turn allowed us to be more critical and analytical of fashion 
      labels. Working with WikiRate made us understand the importance of finding the 
      right and accurate information that backs up or contradicts the image that a 
      fashion label is trying to portray
