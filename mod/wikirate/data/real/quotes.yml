      \r\ntransparency. Their system made it possible to connect data reported by
      brands and \r\nworkers in one dynamic tool: Fashion Checker. Through this flexible
      and engaging \r\nstructure, we were able to make a complex dataset on supply
      chain wages accessible \r\nand useful to a broad audience of consumers, journalists,
      advocacy organizations, \r\nand workers themselves.\r\n"

      our research \r\nskills which in turn allowed us to be more critical and analytical
      of fashion \r\nlabels. Working with WikiRate made us understand the importance
      of finding the \r\nright and accurate information that backs up or contradicts
      the image that a \r\nfashion label is trying to portray\r\n"

    :quote: There are many creative ways to incorporate the WikiRate platform, particularly
      for business-related courses. While my course was project-based, WikiRate data
      can just as easily be used for writing-intensive courses for company-, industry-
      or geography-based analyses. The platform is free to use, and the WikiRate staff
      does a tremendous job addressing student queries. I highly recommend utilizing
      the WikiRate platform to enhance the learning experience at undergraduate and
      graduate levels.

    :quote: I loved right away that WikiRate is community-driven and brings together
      students, professionals, and data lovers from all stages of life and all over
      the world. I had been working on questions of corporate sustainability for a
      number of years, and WikiRate's approach showed me a new perspective to many
      questions around companies' performance on the issues I care about. The WikiRate
      community is simply amazing and I've met a lot of great individuals through
      being involved.
