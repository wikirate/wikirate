# Deckorate Attribution

This mod introduces the Reference card type. The form for generating references
is an attribution generator, and the reference cards themselves comprise reference 
tracking.

Each reference has:
- a :subject, meaning the data in referential use
- a :party, whom the reference attributes
- an :adaptation, noting whether the data was adapted
- a title
- a :url

Two abstract sets facilitate the use of References and their custom views:

- **Card::Set::Abstract::Attributable** - when this abstract set is included in
  a card set, that set has extra UI to support attributions for those cards. 
  Specifically, datasets, metrics, and answers include this set.
- **Card::Set::Abstract::AttributableSearch** - including this abstract set means
  that exports of its searches will be accompanied by a reminder to attribute 
  the results.
