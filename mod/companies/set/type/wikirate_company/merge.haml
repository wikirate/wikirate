  %h1 Merge Companies
  %p.lead
    This page, visible only to moderators, supports the first step
    in merging duplicate companies.

  %h5 From Company (source)
  .bg-white
    = render_bar

  .alert-warning.my-4.p-3
    NOTE: Starting here means you plan to
    %em get rid of
    the above company
    %em
      = "(#{render_link})"
    after moving all or most of its information to another
    company on WikiRate.org. If that is not your intent,
    %em run.
    Or, I guess, navigate to a company you do want to get rid of.

  %h5 To Company (target)
  = render_merge_form

  %hr.my-4
  %h5 Process
  %ol
    %li
      Submit the above form. This will move all of the following to the target company:
      %ol
        %li non-conflicting answers
        %li dataset listings
        %li explicit company group listings
        %li company tags on sources
    %li
      Resolve answer conflicts. Delete each answer from the source company when it's
      resolved.
    %li
      Confirm that no additional details need to be moved to the target company.
      For example, ensure correct integration mapping (Wikipedia and OpenCorporates)
      on the target company.
    %li
      Delete the source company.
