# Feature: search feature
  # As user I can search and use paging to browse through search results

  # Scenario: quick search
    # Given I go to the homepage
    # And I search for "Jedi rating" using the navbox
    # Then I should see "darkness rating"
    #    When I click on "2"
    #    Then I should see "deadliness"
