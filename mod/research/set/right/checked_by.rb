include_set Abstract::LookupField

# +checked_by stores the current check state as follows:
# empty/non-existent: no check
# refer to "request": double check is requested
# refer to one or more users: the users checked the value
#
# We have to distinguish between
# "double check currently requested" and
# "double check was requested before it was double checked"
# so that the value can get its "requested" state back if somebody
# removes his double check. We use the +check_requested_by card for that.
# If the double check is requested the requester is
# stored (permanently) in +check_requested_by and +checked_by is set
# to "request". A double check removes the "request" and adds the checker to
# +checked_by but the requester stays in +check_requested_by.
