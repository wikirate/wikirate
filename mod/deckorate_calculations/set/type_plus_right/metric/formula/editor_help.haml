    To write a formula, use the variables defined in the table above in the editor
    inside the "CoffeeScript" tab. Once you have a formula that produces no errors,
    you can save this formula as part of a "Calculated Metric". All the answers to that
    metric produced by the formula will appear on WikiRate, and new answers will be
    calculated as data becomes available.

    A simple formula might just use mathematical operations like addition (
    %strong> +
    ), subtraction (
    %strong -
    ), multiplication (
    %strong *
    ), and division (
    %strong /
    ). For example, if you have a variable named "percentRenewable", then
    you can make a formula to find the percent NOT renewable by doing something like this:

  .p-2.pb-3
    %code
      100 - percentRenewable

  %p
    A slightly more advanced formula might use an if-else statement, like so:

  .p-2.pb-3
    %code
      if sharePercent > 10
      .pl-3 "Major"
      else
      .pl-3 "Minor"

  %p
    Indentation matters in CoffeeScript, so if you didn't indent the "Major" and
    "Minor" lines in the code above, it wouldn't work.

    If you're comfortable with spreadsheets, you will likely be able to get the hang of
    WikiRate formulae. In fact, we support a lot of

    thanks to
    = link_to "Formula.js.", href: "https://formulajs.info/functions/",
                             target: "_formula_help"
    For example, you can sum two variables like so:

  .p-2.pb-3
    %code
      SUM tier1, tier2

    As you write your formula, look in the Answers tab to get feedback on what kinds of
    results are being produced. Note that these results are being calculated dynamically
    in your browser, and there are some differences in your browser environment and the
    server environment in which the published answers are calculated. Code that you
    write here will NOT be run directly in anyone else's browser.
