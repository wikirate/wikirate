    # CACHED COUNTS

    # TODO: optimize
    # by looking for opportunities not to update cached counts, eg:
    # when a company's answers are merely updated (not added or removed),
    # the company has same number of answers and metrics before and after the calculation,
    # so there is no need to recount
    #
    # have not yet confirmed with benchmarking, but it appears that these cached count
    # updates are the slowest remaining part of the calculation process
    #
    # we could also consider some sort of bulk querying/counting/updating mechanism,
    # but that's a heavier lift than just avoiding counts that don't need to be made.
