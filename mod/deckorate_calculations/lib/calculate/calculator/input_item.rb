    # {InputItem} represents a nested metric in a formula.
    # For example "{{Jedi+friendliness|year: -1}}" in the formula
    # "{{Jedi+friendliness|year: -1}} + 10 / {{Jedi+deadliness}}"
    #
    # It is responsible for finding all relevant values for that input item.
    # How this is handled depends on the nest options (year and/or company)
    # The logic for the nest options is in the modules {CompanyOption} and {YearOption}
    #
    # A metric with a fixed company is option company independent.
    # That's why the company dependency is separated into the modules
    # {CompanyDependentInput} and {CompanyIndependentInput}
